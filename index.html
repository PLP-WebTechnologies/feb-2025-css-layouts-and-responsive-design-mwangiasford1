               <p class="items1"> Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a powerful CSS layout model that makes it easier to design flexible and responsive
                layouts. It allows you to control the alignment, direction, and spacing of elements efficiently.
                
                Key Concepts:
                Flex Container: The parent element that holds flex items. You enable flexbox by setting display: flex; on the container.
                
                Flex Items: The child elements inside the flex container that are affected by flexbox properties.
                
                Main Axis & Cross Axis: Flexbox works in one dimension at a time—either horizontally (row) or vertically (column).
                
                Flex Properties:

                    how to resorve an overflow
                    Overflow issues can arise in different contexts—are you referring to a CSS layout overflow, a database overflow, or
                    something else entirely?
                    
                    If it's CSS overflow, you can control how content behaves when it exceeds its container using the overflow property:
                    
                    visible: Content spills outside the container.
                    
                    hidden: Content is clipped and not visible.
                    
                    scroll: Adds scrollbars to navigate excess content.
                    
                    auto: Scrollbars appear only when necessary.
